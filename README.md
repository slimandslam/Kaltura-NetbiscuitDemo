Kaltura-NetbiscuitDemo
======================

A mobile demo I wrote using Netbiscuit's markup language and PHP5.

It uses the Kaltura API to retrieve various assets (video, photos, and sound files) from a Kaltura server.

Although the demo is still hosted on the Netbiscuit's site, it probably doesn't work anymore because
the server it uses is probably no longer running.
